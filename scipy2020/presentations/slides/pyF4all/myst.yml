  title: 'Molecular infrastructure for modeling viruses with pythonic-mediated packages: pyF4all'
  authors:
    - name: Horacio V. Guzman
  abstract: We model full viruses by coupling short highly-detailed molecular dynamics simulations with lower-resolution (but faster) continuum electrostatic models. Such multiscale approach enables to model a full virus in a desktop/small cluster-level infrastructure, which are available for most researchers. Here, we propose a first interfacing of the pythonic-like packages in a multiscale approach that automatizes the access to state-of-the-art biomolecular simulations via Jupyter Notebooks.
