  abstract: This talk describes Arkouda, a Python package that we have developed for doing exploratory analysis on massive data sets at interactive rates. Arkouda's API is based on NumPy/Pandas, yet its arrays can be transparently distributed across the compute nodes of a cluster or supercomputer to support large-scale analytics. In our work, we have run Arkouda operations from Jupyter notebooks on TB-sized data sets in seconds to small numbers of minutesâ€”achieving scalability and performance that we have not observed with competing technologies.
