    "description": "From a humble beginning as a side effort using a Raspberry Pi to talk to lightning instruments, Project Mjolnir is evolving into a modular, open source client-server platform for developing scientific IoT sensor networks. Its goal is to enable scientists of many disciplines to employ low-cost hardware to robustly ingest, log and uplink periodic and on-demand science and engineering data and commands, controlled either autonomously or centrally, all with little or no bespoke code. The talk will discuss Mjolnirâ€™s development and future, present examples of current projects built on it, and explore how to leverage it for new applications."
