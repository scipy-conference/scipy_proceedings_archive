    "description": "Quantify uncertainty and sensitivities in your existing computational models with the “monaco” library. Users define input variables randomly drawn from any of SciPy's statistical distributions, run their model in parallel anywhere from 1 to millions of times, and postprocess the outputs to obtain meaningful, statistically significant conclusions. This talk goes over why you should always be running Monte Carlo simulations, a demo of how to set up and run a sim, and a crash course in generating relevant plots and statistics.",
