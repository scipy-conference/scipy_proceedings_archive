The annual SciPy Conferences allows participants from academic, commercial, and governmental organizations to:

- showcase their latest Scientific Python projects,
- learn from skilled users and developers, and
- collaborate on code development.

The conferences generally consists of multiple days of tutorials followed by two-three days of presentations, and concludes with 1-2 days developer sprints on projects of interest to the attendees.
