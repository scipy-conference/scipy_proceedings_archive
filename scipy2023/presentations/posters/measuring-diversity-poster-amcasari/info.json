    "description": "If we fundamentally believe that 'Open source is for everyone', how do we know we are actually bringing everyone in, meeting them where they are, and fostering a diverse and inclusive open source ecosystem? Our open source team has evolved our practices for measuring open source communities, and the impact we have on them.
