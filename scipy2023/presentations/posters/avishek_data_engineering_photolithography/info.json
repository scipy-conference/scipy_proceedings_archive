    "description": "With smaller chips, requirements on chemical suppliers to control material parameters used in semiconductor manufacturing are stricter. DuPont Electronics & Industrial is working to improve the quality of photolithography products. Our goal is to pre-emptively identify failures and minimize defects using data science and statistics. This requires good data engineering practices in a challenging enterprise IT environment with multiple systems. We present a practical approach to overcome these, and collect and organize data using open-source python tools to help domain experts and practitioners. We describe approaches to scale this effort, which should be relevant to chemistry and manufacturing practitioners.",
