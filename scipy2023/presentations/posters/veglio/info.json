    "title": "Yori: a new, highly customizable tool for Level-3 data production",
    "description": "Yori is a highly customizable, sensor-agnostic software, developed to support the NASA Atmosphere Science Teams, to spatially/temporally resample geophysical variables from satellite measurements. Out of the box this software outputs common statistics, such as mean, standard deviation and pixel count, of each geophysical variable read, for every grid cell. Additionally, Yori allows users to easily produce additional statistics (e.g. histograms, min/max, median) and filter data to create custom outputs while maintaining a CF-compliant format. Yori has been designed to be easily scalable on a distributed computing environment.",
