    "description": "The array API standard (https://data-apis.org/array-api/) is a common specification for Python array libraries, such as NumPy, PyTorch, CuPy, Dask, and JAX. This standard will make it straightforward for array-consuming libraries, like scikit-learn and SciPy, to write code that uniformly supports all of these libraries. This will allow, for instance, running the same code on the CPU and GPU. This talk covers the scope of the array API standard, supporting tooling which includes a library-independent test suite and compatibility layer, what work has been completed so far, and the plans going forward.",
