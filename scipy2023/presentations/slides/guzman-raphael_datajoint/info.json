    "description": "Relational databases manage structured data and facilitate queries in collaborative repositories, but using SQL from a scientific programming language is awkward. DataJoint is an open-source framework for managing scientific data supporting data definition, diagramming, and queries. DataJoint makes computation a native part of its data model, bridging the gap between databases and numerical analysis in automated workflows.",
