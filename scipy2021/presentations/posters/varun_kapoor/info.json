    "description": "Live-cell imaging is highly used technique to study cell migration and dynamics over tile. Automated analysis of florescently membrane-labelled cells can be highly challenging due to their irregular shape, variability in size and dynamic movement across Z planes making it difficult to detect and track them. Ze introduce a detailed analysis pipeline to perform segmentation with accurate shape information, combined with BTrackmate, a customized codebase of popular ImageJ/Fiji software Trackmate, to perform cell tracking inside the tissue of interest. We also created an interface in Napari to visualize the tracks along a chosen view making it possible to follow a cell along the plane of motion. We provide a detailed protocaol to implement this pipeline in a new dataset, together with the required Jupyter notebooks."
