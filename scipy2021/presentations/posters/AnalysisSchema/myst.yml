  abstract: Scientific workflow description provides an alternative to the cognitive overhead of learning a new software package and use of imperative programming paradigms often used with python. This description is encoded in a JSON schema, accessed by the user through a configuration file, and run using python modules that attach the configuration file to the code which produces output. We use yt, an computational astrophyics tool, to demonstrate how a domain specific software can operate within a descriptive framework.
