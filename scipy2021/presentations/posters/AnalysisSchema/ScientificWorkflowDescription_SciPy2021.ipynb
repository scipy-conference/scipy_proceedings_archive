    "Working with scientific data and open source software requires understanding a myriad of tools and best practices. Analysis and visualization using python and open source relies on paradigms like imperative programming and for loops to write code and nuances in syntax like dot notation. After that, there's learning the internal functionality of individual packages, which are often domain specific. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interdisciplinary work provides an extra barrier, as new ways of thinking and new tools are added to the work load, butting heads with the domain focused tools available. While discovery and reconfiguration of software tools can be an intersection of creativity and innovation, too often learning curves get in the way and slow research down, or cause the wheel to be reinvented over and over again in each domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Scientific workflow description** provides an alternative to the cognitive overhead of learning a new software package and use of imperative programming paradigms often used with python. We aim to unite the core aspects of interdisciplinary computational work using common natural science mental models while removing inherent domain-specific workflow and computing language barriers, creating an accessible scientific query environment. **This description is encoded in a JSON schema, accessed by the user through a configuration file, and run using python modules that attach the configuration file to the code which produces output.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, 'the code' is [yt](http://yt-project.org/), an open source python library designed for scientific analysis and visualization of volumetric data from the physical sciences. We use yt, an computational astrophyics tool, to demonstrate how a domain specific software can operate within a descriptive framework. **Future work will include support for multiple python libaries across several domains.** \n",

    "|![](images/AnalysisSchemaWorkflowLarge.png)| What does it mean to *describe* a workflow? **We have developed a scientific workflow description prototype, which is divided into three different pieces - the JSON schema, a browser interface for user interaction, and a render-engine that will execute the code**. Using a configuration file which will live in the broswer, users can select actions and add appropriate data for those actions which are controled by the JSON schema. Users can then submit this file to the rendering engine, creating output for their work. <br><br>This creates a flexible, language-agnostic, and structured way for users to explore, analysis and visualize natural science data. It weaves human and language together, in a way that fits with how both human and machine *think* about the data and the program. Our work is currently supporting yt, but the schema could be extended to other python libraries. \n",
