     "description": "Accurate, precise, and low-noise sensor measurements are essential before any machine can learn about (or artificial-intelligently make decisions about) the physical world. Modern, highly integrated signal acquisition devices can perform analog signal conditioning, digitization, and digital filtering on a single silicon device, greatly simplifying system electronics. However, a complete understanding of the signal chain properties is still required to correctly utilize and debug these modern devices."
