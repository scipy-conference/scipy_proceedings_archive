title: 'cesium: Open-Source Platform for Time-Series Inference'
description: 'Inference on time series data is a common requirement in many
  scientific disciplines and internet of things (IoT) applications, yet there
  are few resources available to domain scientists to easily, robustly, and
  repeatably build such complex inference workflows: traditional statistical
  models of time series are often too rigid to explain complex time domain
  behavior, while popular machine learning packages require already-featurized
  dataset inputs.'

  Inference on time series data is a common requirement in many
  scientific disciplines and internet of things (IoT) applications, yet there
  are few resources available to domain scientists to easily, robustly, and
  repeatably build such complex inference workflows: traditional statistical
  models of time series are often too rigid to explain complex time domain
  behavior, while popular machine learning packages require already-featurized
  dataset inputs. Moreover, the software engineering tasks required to
  instantiate the computational platform are daunting. cesium is an end-to-end
  time series analysis framework, consisting of a Python library as well as a
  web front-end interface, that allows researchers to featurize raw data and
  apply modern machine learning techniques in a simple, reproducible, and
  extensible way. Users can apply out-of-the-box feature engineering workflows
  as well as save and replay their own analyses. Any steps taken in the front
  end can also be exported to a Jupyter notebook, so users can iterate between
  possible models within the front end and then fine-tune their analysis using
  the additional capabilities of the back-end library. The open-source packages
  make us of many use modern Python toolkits, including xarray, dask, Celery,
  Flask, and scikit-learn.
