  "description": "A grocery list is an integral part of the shopping experience of many consumers. First, we propose a new machine learning model written in Python 3 that predicts which grocery products the consumer will buy again or will try to buy for the first time, and in which store(s) the purchase will be made. Second, we introduce a smart shopping template to provide consumers with a personalized weekly shopping list based on their shopping history and known preferences. As the explanatory variables, we used available grocery shopping history, weekly product promotion information for a given region, as well as the product price statistics."
