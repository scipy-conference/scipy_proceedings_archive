  abstract: |
    Being able to regrid between various grid types is very important in geoscience research. While the scientific
    python ecosystem includes numerous geospatial regridding packages, most of them are tailored to only a few specific
    grid types. Additionally, very few of them are designed to handle regridding of grids that are too big to fit into
    memory using distributed computation frameworks like `dask`.

    `grid-indexing` and `grid-weights` are a set of rust-based libraries that implement regridding between arbitrary
    grids using a RTree and rely on `dask` to scale for larger-than-memory grids.
