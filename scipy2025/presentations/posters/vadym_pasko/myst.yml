  abstract: >
    Curve fitting is a fundamental task in data science, engineering, and scientific computing, 
    enabling researchers to extract meaningful relationships from data. 
    However, selecting and tuning the right fitting model for complex, noisy, or multidimensional data remains a significant challenge.
    SciPy plays a critical role in addressing these challenges by providing robust spline fitting methods that offer flexibility and precision. 
    Yet, fine-tuning spline parameters, ensuring stability in extrapolation, and sharing fitted models for reproducibility remain open problems.

    In order to address these challenges, we developed SplineCloud - an open platform that provides interactive spline fitting capabilities 
    and uses SciPy on the backend. SplineCloud allows the construction, analysis, and exchange of spline-based regression models 
    using SciPy’s `interpolate` module. SplineCloud’s curve fitting tool extends the capabilities of SciPy spline fitting methods 
    by enabling researchers to fine-tune spline parameters: knot vector, control points, and degree interactively, 
    instantly analyzing the accuracy of models. Models constructed on the platform obtain their unique identifiers and become reusable in code, 
    fostering better collaboration and knowledge transfer. Reusability of spline curves and underlying datasets in code is enabled via 
    the open-source SplineCloud client library called `splinecloud-scipy`, which is also based on SciPy. 
    The proposed approach of interactive cloud-based fitting improves data processing workflows, allows separating data preparation and 
    approximation routines from the main code, and brings FAIR principles to the curve fitting, enabling researchers to construct and share 
    libraries of empirical data relations.
