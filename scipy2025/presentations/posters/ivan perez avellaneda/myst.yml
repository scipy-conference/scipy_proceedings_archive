    In this paper, CFSpy a package in Python that numerically computes Chen-Fliess series
    is presented. The reachable sets of non-linear systems are also
    calculated with this package. The method used obtains batches of iterated integrals
    of the same length instead one of at a time. For this, we consider the alphabetical
    order of the words that index the series. By redefining the iterated
    integral reading the index word in the opposite direction from right
    to left, we allow the broadcasting of the computation of the iterated
    integral to all permutations of a length. Assuming the input
    is sufficiently well approximated by piecewise step functions in 
    a fine partition of the time interval, the minimum bounding box of a 
    reachable set is computed by means of polynomials in terms of the inputs. To solve the optimization problem, the SciPy library is used.
