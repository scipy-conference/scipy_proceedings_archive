  abstract: |
    This poster examines the acceleration of quantum chemistry calculations
    through modern implementations of Density Functional Theory (DFT). We
    present a comparative performance analysis between traditional frameworks
    and optimized implementations, demonstrating substantial computational
    efficiency gains. Applications to electrolyte membrane structure analysis
    illustrate practical benefits, enabling more extensive simulations in
    reduced timeframes. Benchmarks highlight speedups achieved via modern code
    optimization techniques in Python-based quantum chemistry environments.
