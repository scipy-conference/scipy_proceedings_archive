  abstract: |
    As machine learning models become increasingly accurate and complex, 
    explainability has become essential to ensure trust, transparency, and informed decision-making. 
    SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) provide a rigorous and intuitive approach for 
    interpreting model predictions, delivering consistent and theoretically grounded feature attributions. 
    This article demonstrates the application of SHAP across two representative model types: 
    boosted decision trees and neural networks.
