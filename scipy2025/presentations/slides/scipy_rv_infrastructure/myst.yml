  abstract: |
    The SciPy library provides objects representing well over 100 univariate probability distributions. These have served the scientific Python ecosystem for decades, but they are built upon an infrastructure that has not kept up with the demands of today’s users. To address its shortcomings, SciPy 1.15 includes a new infrastructure for working with probability distributions. This talk will introduce users to the new infrastructure and demonstrate its many advantages in terms of usability, flexibility, accuracy, and performance.
