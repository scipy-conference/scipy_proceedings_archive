  abstract: |
    We have added functionality for running depletion simulations independently
    of neutron transport in OpenMC, an open source Monte Carlo particle
    transport code with an internal depletion module. Transport-independent
    depletion uses pre-computed static multigroup cross sections and fluxes to
    calculate reaction rates for OpenMC's depletion matrix solver. This
    accelerates the depletion calculation, but removes the spatial coupling
    between depletion and neutron transport.

    We used a simple PWR pincell to validate the method against the existing
    transport-coupled depletion method.  Nuclide concentration errors roughly
    scale with depletion time step size and are inversely proportional to the
    amount of the nuclide present in a depletable material. The magnitude of
    concentration error depends on the nuclide of interest. Concentration errors
    for low-abundance nuclides at longer (30-day) time steps exhibit large
    negative initial concentration the becomes more positive with time due to
    overestimation of nuclide production stemming from the lack of spatial
    coupling to neutron transport. For ten 3-day time steps, fission product
    concentration errors are all under 3\%.  Actinide concentration errors range
    from 10-15\% for Am and Cm, 5-7\% for Pu and Np, and 2\% and less for U.
    Surprisingly, the numbers are similar for 30-day time steps. These results
    demonstrate the potential of this new method with moderate accuracy and
    extraordinary time savings for low and medium fidelity simulations.
    Concentration error characterization on larger models remains an open area of
    interest.
