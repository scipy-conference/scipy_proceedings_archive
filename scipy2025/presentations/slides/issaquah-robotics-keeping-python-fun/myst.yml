  abstract: >
    The Issaquah Robotics Society (IRS) has been teaching Python and data
    analysis to high school students since 2016. Our presentation will
    summarize what we’ve learned from nine years of combining Python,
    competitive robotics, and high school students with no prior programming
    experience. We’ll focus on the importance of keeping it fun, learning the
    tools, and how to provide useful feedback without making learning Python
    feel like just another class. We’ll also explain how Python helps us win
    robotics competitions.
