  abstract: |
    The practice of data science in genomics is fraught with friction. This is
    largely due to a tight coupling of bioinformatic tools to file input/output,
    where storage formats are frequently standardized but complex and siloed. In
    this talk, I argue that the adoption of open standards not restricted to
    bioinformatics can help better integrate bioinformatic workflows into the
    wider data science, visualization, and AI/ML ecosystems by promoting
    "composable" architectures. I present two bridge libraries as vignettes for
    composable genomic data science. The first, Anywidget, is an architecture and
    toolkit based on modern web standards for sharing interactive widgets across
    all Jupyter-compatible runtimes, including JupyterLab, Google Colab, VSCode,
    Marimo, and more. The second, Oxbow, is a Rust and Python-based
    library that unifies access to common NGS data formats by efficiently
    transforming queries into Apache Arrow, a standard in-memory columnar
    representation for tabular data analytics. I demonstrate the use of these
    libraries to build custom connected genomic analysis and visualization
    environments. I propose that bridge libraries such as these, which leverage
    domain-agnostic standards to unbundle specialized file manipulation,
    analytics, and web interactivity, can serve as the glue for assembling
    reusable and flexible genomic data analysis and machine learning workflows as
    well as systems for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
