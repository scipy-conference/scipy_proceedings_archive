  abstract: |
    Three years ago, with the arrival of ChatGPT, the world of AI entered a new
    era. Apllications and tools using AI flourished. However, the security
    risks of using AI are still not all fully understood. In particular, there
    is little thought paid to the supply chain security of a model. Tampering
    with a model has significant impact downstream. In this talk, we show how
    building upon tamper-proof metadata for ML artifacts, we can secure the ML
    supply chain. That is, we show how the OpenSSF model signing secures the
    most important part of the ML supply chain: the model.
