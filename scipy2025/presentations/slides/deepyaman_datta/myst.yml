  abstract: >
    For the past decade, tools like dbt have formed a cornerstone of the modern data
    stack, and Python-first alternatives couldn't compete with the scale and performance
    of modern SQL—until now. New integrations with Ibis, the portable Python dataframe
    library, enable building and orchestrating scalable data engineering pipelines using
    existing open-source libraries like Kedro, Pandera, and more.
