  title: 'Unlocking the Missing 78%: Inclusive Communities for the Future of Scientific Python'

  abstract: |
    Scientific Python teams are leaving value on the table—the Missing78%—and it shows up in slower
    product cycles and brittle processes. This talk introduces the VIM framework (Visibility, Impact,
    Mechanisms) as a lightweight operating system for product development: define visible contribution
    ladders, focus on measurable impact, and install mechanisms that make responsible AI practices
    repeatable. Attendees leave with a one-page checklist, repo templates, and a 30-day plan to ship
    scientifically grounded, responsible-AI improvements—without extra headcount.

    Keywords: product development, VIM framework, Missing78%, scientific Python, responsible AI, contribution ladders, mechanisms, measurable impact
