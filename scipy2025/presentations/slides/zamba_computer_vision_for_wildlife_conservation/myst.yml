  abstract: >-
    Camera traps are an essential tool for wildlife research. Zamba is an open source Python package that leverages
    machine learning and computer vision to automate time-intensive processing tasks for wildlife camera trap data.
    This talk will dive into Zamba's capabilities and key factors that influenced its design and development.
    Topics will include the importance of code-free custom model training, Zamba's origins in an open machine
    learning competition, and the technical challenges of processing video data. Attendees will walk away with a
    better understanding of how machine learning and Python tools can support conservation efforts.
