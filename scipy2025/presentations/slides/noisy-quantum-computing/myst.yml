  abstract: |
    Today's quantum computers are far noisier than their classical counterparts.
    Unlike traditional computing errors, quantum noise is more complex, arising from decoherence, crosstalk, and gate imperfections that corrupt quantum states.
    Error mitigation has become a rapidly evolving field, offering ways to address these errors on existing devices.
    New techniques emerge regularly, requiring flexible tools for implementation and testing.
    This talk explores the challenges of mitigating noise and how researchers and engineers use Python to iterate quickly while maintaining reliable and reproducible workflows.
