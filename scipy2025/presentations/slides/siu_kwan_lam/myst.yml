  abstract: |
    The rapidly evolving Python ecosystem presents increasing challenges for 
    adapting code using traditional methods. Developers frequently need to 
    rewrite applications to leverage new libraries, hardware architectures, 
    and optimization techniques. To address this challenge, the Numba team is 
    developing a superoptimizing compiler built on equality saturation-based 
    term rewriting. This innovative approach enables domain experts to express
    and share optimizations without requiring extensive compiler expertise. 
    This talk explores how Numba v2 enables sophisticated optimizations—from 
    floating-point approximation and automatic GPU acceleration to 
    energy-efficient multiplication for deep learning models—all through the 
    familiar NumPy API. Join us to discover how Numba v2 is bringing 
    superoptimization capabilities to the Python ecosystem.
