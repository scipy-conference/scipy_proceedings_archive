  title: 'Enhancing Curve Fitting with SciPy: Interactive Spline Modeling and Reproducibility with SplineCloud'
  # subtitle:
  description: This article explores how SciPy’s spline fitting tools power the core of SplineCloud — an open platform for interactive constructing and sharing regression models. It introduces a modern workflow for creating, refining, and reusing curve-fitting models, making data modeling and analysis more transparent, collaborative, and reproducible.
