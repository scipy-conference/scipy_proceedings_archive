  title: 'Quantum Chemistry Acceleration: Comparative Performance Analysis of Modern DFT Implementations'
  # subtitle:
  description: |
    This paper examines the acceleration of quantum chemistry calculations through
    modern implementations of Density Functional Theory (DFT). We present a
    comparative performance analysis between traditional frameworks and optimized
    implementations, demonstrating substantial computational efficiency gains.
    Applications to electrolyte membrane structure analysis illustrate practical
    benefits, enabling more extensive simulations in reduced timeframes. Benchmarks
    highlight speedups achieved via modern code optimization techniques in Python-based
    quantum chemistry environments.
