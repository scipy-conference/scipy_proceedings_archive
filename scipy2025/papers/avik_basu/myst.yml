  title: Explaining ML predictions with SHAP
  subtitle: Intuition, use cases, and best practices
  description: |
    This article explores how SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) can be used to interpret machine learning model 
    predictions by providing consistent and theoretically grounded feature attributions.
