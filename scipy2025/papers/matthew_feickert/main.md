title: Reproducible Machine Learning Workflows for Scientists with Pixi
abstract: |
  Scientific researchers need reproducible software environments for complex applications that can run across heterogeneous computing platforms.
  Modern open source tools, like Pixi, provide automatic reproducibility solutions for all dependencies while providing a high level interface well suited for researchers.
  Combined with the recent emergence of the entire CUDA software stack &mdash; from compilers to development libraries &mdash; being supported on conda-forge, researchers are now able to easily specify their exact hardware acceleration requirements and software dependencies and get portable computational environments locked down to the digest level.
