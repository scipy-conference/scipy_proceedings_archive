  title: Reproducible Machine Learning Workflows for Scientists with Pixi
  # subtitle:
  description: |
    Scientific researchers need reproducible software environments for complex applications that can run across heterogeneous computing platforms.
    Modern open source tools, like Pixi and the CUDA conda-forge packages, provide reproducibility solutions for while providing high level semantics well suited for researchers.
