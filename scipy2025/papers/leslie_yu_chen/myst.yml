  title: Imprecise uncertainty management with uncertain numbers to facilitate trustworthy computations
  # subtitle:
  description: This paper demonstrates the framework of uncertain number which allows for a closed computation ecosystem whereby trustful computations can be conducted in a rigorous manner. This paper presents an overview of the main capabilities of the library PyUncertainNumber.
