  title: 'Numba v2: Towards a SuperOptimizing Python Compiler'
  # subtitle:
  description: This paper presents early work on Numba v2, a general-purpose compiler for Python that integrates equality saturation (EqSat) as a foundation for program analysis and transformation. Whilst inspired in part by the needs of AI/ML workloads, and also supporting tensor optimizations, Numba v2 is not a tensor-oriented compiler. Instead, it provides a flexible framework where user-defined mathematical and domain-specific rewrites participate in the compilation process as a complement to the compilation supported by Numba today.
