  title: Performing Object Detection on Drone Orthomosaics with Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM)
  # subtitle:
  description: This article presents a workflow that utilizes SAM's automatic mask generation skill to effectively perform the task of object detection zero-shot on a high-resolution drone orthomosaic. The generated output is 20% more spatially accurate than that produced using proprietary software, with 400% greater IoU.
