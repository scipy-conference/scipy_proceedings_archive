  title: Extension of the OpenMC depletion module for transport-independent depletion
  # subtitle:
  description: This paper describes new functionality in OpenMC's depletion module for depleting materials independent of a neutron transport simulation. The paper valdiates the capability against transport-coupled depletion on a simple model.
