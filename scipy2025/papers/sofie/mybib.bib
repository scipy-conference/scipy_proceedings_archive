abstract = {Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability or speed, but not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {The high accuracy of detector simulation is crucial for modern particle physics experiments. However, this accuracy comes with a high computational cost, which will be exacerbated by the large datasets and complex detector upgrades associated with next-generation facilities such as the High Luminosity LHC. We explore the viability of regression-based machine learning (ML) approaches using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to “denoise” faster, lower-quality detector simulations, augmenting them to produce a higher-quality final result with a reduced computational burden. The denoising CNN works in concert with classical detector simulation software rather than replacing it entirely, increasing its reliability compared to other ML approaches to simulation. We obtain promising results from a prototype based on photon showers in the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter. Future directions are also discussed.}

abstract = {The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.  It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 1034 cm−2 s−1 (1027 cm−2 s−1).  At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter.  The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4π solid angle.  Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|η| ⩽ 5) assuring very good hermeticity.  The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.}

An introduction to SOFIE (System for Optimized Fast Inference code Emit) is presented, with examples of interface and generated code. We discuss the latest expanded support of a variety of neural network operators, including convolutional and recurrent layers, as well as the integration with RDataFrame. We demonstrate the latest performance of this framework with a set of benchmarks.}
